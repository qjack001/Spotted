*Peperomia obtusifolia* is most commonly found with forest green leaves or in variegated cultivars
like the painting above. With waxy and succulent-like leaves, the plant typically prefers to dry out
between waterings and is prone to root rot if over-watered. That being said, it is a hardy plant that
will tolerate a variety of lighting situations and will not require frequent re-potting, making it
an excellent plant for beginners. The plant can be propagated from both stem and leaf cuttings.
