*Ficus elastica* is an attractive houseplant most commonly found with dark green/burgundy leaves,
but also in variegated cultivars like the painting above. In its natural habitat, the plant commonly
grows into a tree at a height of around 30 to 40 meters tall, and its long, dangling aerial roots
have even been used to form living bridges in India. While you cannot expect to grow anything near
in size at home, rubber plants still grow well in pots and can reach impressive heights if given
substantial room and a well aerated potting mix. The plants are quite hardy and can tolerate some
neglect, but they will thrive best under well lit conditions. Fun fact: while it is possible to use
the sap of the plant to produce rubber, the Pará rubber tree is the plant species of choice for the
commercial cultivation of rubber.
