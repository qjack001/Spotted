Although a common ornamental houseplant and greenhouse favorite, the *Alocasia sanderiana* plant is considered critically endangered its endemic area of the Northern Mindanao region in the Philippines. There are quite a few cultivars of this plant available, common ones including the Alocasia x amazonica hybrid and Alocasia 'polly' (a dwarf variety). While this plant is considered quite fussy by some growers, it will produce beautiful waxy leaves under the right conditions with well draining soil. Just keep in mind that its leaves will brown easily from low humidity or high sunlight!
