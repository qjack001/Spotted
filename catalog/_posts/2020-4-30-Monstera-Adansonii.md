*Monstera adansonii* are a peculiar species from the higher classification *Monstera*. Much like other monsteras, pothos, and philodendrons, the swiss cheese plant does exceptionally well when given a moss poll to climb or allowed to trail down from a pot. This plant requires well draining soil and will prefer to be watered frequently. It is best not to let the soil dry out completly between waterings, but make sure not to soak and drown the plant.
