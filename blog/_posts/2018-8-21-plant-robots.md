At first it was cashiers. Then truck drivers. Time and time again, we brushed it aside, "there will always be jobs," we said. We were wrong. 

When *[willrobotstakemyjob.com](https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/)* inched their predictions on [the automation of computer programmers](https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/15-1131-computer-programmers) up to 48%, everything changed. Suddenly robots seemed destine to take over every job, not just the boring ones, but [the important ones too](https://www.google.com/search?q=jobs+with+high+percent+of+white+people&oq=jobs+with+high+percent+of+white+people&aqs=chrome..69i57.9445j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (not even [dancers were safe](https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/27-2031-dancers?rnd=true), for some reason?).

Anyone who managed to survive the Salt Wars of '33 will remember what happened next quite vividly. It was the summer of 2017 and for the first time, people had woken up. In a last ditch effort to fight back, Computer Programmers [rallied together to march against the robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) who dared steal their jobs. But it was simply too late.

The year that followed was one of despair. Often referred to as ["The Endless Winter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer) by todays historians, 2017 was a hard year for all of humanity. I remember waiting in line for food stamps in November. Everyday the line would grow longer as my fellow developers slowly got picked off one-by-one. The irony is that we were the ones that made them, and we made them unstoppable.

## A Glimmer of Hope:

By the time summer had rolled around, humanity was on its last legs. Faced with its own obsoletion, humanity turned to the only thing it had left: [the Verge.com](https://www.theverge.com/). On July 12th, The Verge published a light-hearted piece entitled [*"This sun-chasing robot looks after the plant on its head"*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563688/robot-plant-hybrid-hexa-vincross-succulent). In the face of true darkness, we had found light.

The article was a huge success, being widely regarded as one of the main events that catapulted Editor-in-Chief [Nilay Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilay_Patel) into his run as Democratic Presidential Candidate in 2024. The article also helped kick-start [Vincross](https://www.vincross.com/hexa), the company building these cute bots (note that this was back when Vincross was a mere startup, not the billion dollar military tech mogul we know and fear today).

The plant-bots sold like hot cakes, and soon nearly every home in Neo-America (simply called "North America" back then) had a one of these cute crawlers. And for a while humanity was safe; mildly distracted by a new toy, momentarily unaware of their inevitable fate.

## 2019:

On New Years Eve, Anderson Cooper accompanied by some forgettable co-host, took to the airways to broadcast the annual Ball-Drop in New York City. Anderson's frosty breath is just barley noticeable by the camera, but a chilling foreshadowing to anyone looking back now. By the time February had rolled around it was clear something was different. Weather stations were running out of "COLDEST EVER" headlines, and the cold-snap's fatality rate was quickly climbing. Believed to be most likely caused by climate change (this was back before [climate change was proven to be a hoax](http://www.ideacity.ca/video/global-warming-hoax-lord-christopher-monckton/)), the winter of 2019 was the most deadly ever on record. And as we'd soon find out, not just for us humans.

You see when programming an AI, it can seem so tedious to have to explain to it what a plant is, and what the sun is, and how much sun is too much sun, and how much is too little. Instead, simply giving the machine a recognizable failure state allows it to learn how to prevent that state from ever occurring again. So the cute plant-headed robots in every American home was given one directive: avoid plant death.

When February's frosts began to kill-off Vincross's plant-bot's plants, the bots took notice. Each death was converted to a data node and set through the network. With over 400 million bots online, it was only a matter of hours before they had found a solution.

> “One directive: avoid plant death.”

## The Culling

At first the bots merely cut us out. Easily hacking into our energy plants, all power was diverted to large UV emitters that the bots could huddle around. Those that perished in the cold would be repurposed as compost in the Spring's thaw. It wasn't until humans began fighting back that the robots determined us a threat too. 

Needless to say, we were an easy target. With humanity already crippled from the years before, the robots were swift in their genocide. After a futile few months, humanity accepted its defeat, retreating to the Tunnels.

And that brings us to today. With many veterans of the Bio-Bot Rise passing away, I fear our history may be lost. We must always reflect on our mistakes, as well as be thankful for what we have. Remember those who gave their lives so that our children could call the Tunnels "home". And remember that there was a time before Bio-Bots were the dominate life form on Earth, and there will be a time after. May we one day see it.
