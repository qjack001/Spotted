title: Ella's list of plants with a cohesive aesthetic

Although I really enjoy collecting and experimenting with as many plant varieties as possible, I find the idea of curating a specific plant aesthetic for a house really interesting. I've pretty arbitrarily decided to stick with a maximum of 5 different plant species in my list, but I think this can be modified for different scenarios. Side note- while putting this together, I realized there are many factors to take into consideration when selecting a group of plants to suit a home's aesthetic... so expect a few follow up posts. I've written down some considerations I thought about for this post, just to look back to when I come up with future ideas. 

**Considerations for a plant aesthetic:**
1. Max number of different species: 5
2. How big is the space?
3. What is the lighting situation?
4. What is the architecture style, interior design situation, and general space feel?
5. What is the climate?
6. Try having a variety of plant forms- some trailing, some fixed, etc.
7. Variety of foliage and foliage size 
8. Different plant sizes

Based off of these, I've tried creating a list as general as possible that I think would suit most climates, lighting, and design styles. 

## Plant #1: Pothos/devil's ivy (*Epipremnum aureum*)

Pothos's might be one of my favorite plants of all time. They make beautiful hanging curtains, can vine upwards, and will do well in pretty much any space. They will grow well in low light, but will flourish in higher light and grow large leaves. There are also many interesting varities that could be used to avoid to avoid too much repitition if the same plant is used multiple times in the same room. The plant will provide nice small to medium sized leaves, and highly dense foliage.

## Plant #2: Monstera plant/swiss cheese plant (*Monstera deliciosa*)

Monsteras are the dramatic, giant tropical plant everyone needs for their home. Like pothos, they are also fairly flexible in their light requirements, but they provide huge foliage more spaced out in the plant. It's a great plant to place in a big pot on the floor or on a sturdy piece of furniture. 

## Plant #3: Staghorn fern or Bird's nest fern (*Platycerium or Asplenium nidus*)

I know, I know... I said I'd narrow it down to 5. I just think both plants provide the same kind of aesthetic, so in the end you just choose one based on personal preference. Both staghorn ferns and bird's next ferns provide some nice texture- without being a high maintenance fern that needs constant misting. They are also both on the smaller end if kept in medium pots, and would therefore fit nicely on a shelf, a desk, or any little corner that needs a plant. They provide a nice break from leaf based foliage and have varied frond shapes.

## Plant #4: Fiddle-leaf fig (*Ficus lyrata*)

I deliberated quite a bit before including the fig plant, as they also have fairly large leaves, but I think it provides a nice balance considering how many tropical plants are on this list. Additionally, they are the only plant on here that can actually grow into a decently sized tree... and who doesn't want a tree in their house? They're also good with most light conditions, so I feel like its generally a pretty great plant to have (but considering it was one of my first plants, I'm a bit biased)

This is Summer Rayne's fig plant, just to give you an idea on how big they can get! (Side note: a fiddle-leaf fig was also her first plant!)

## Plant #5: "Baby rubber plant" (*Peperomia obtusifolia*)

I wasn't quite sure what to include here... but given how many large plants I've included, I figured I should include something with smaller/compact leaves. I've recently really fallen in love with peperomias, and I think peperomia obtusifolia (also commonly known as the baby rubber plant, even though it's not a rubber plant at all) has really nice shiny, dark green foliage. The plants would look nice in small pots scattered around a house. There's some variegated varities if needed, and you can also get plants with slightly smaller/larger leaves. They are also pretty robust to most conditions, so I think they make a pretty good candidate for this list. 

## Honorable mentions: snake plant and philodendron (*Sansevieria trifasciata and Philodendron bipinnatifidum*)

It was pretty hard choosing a 5th plant... so I figured I'd include a few a deliberated over as well. I think any of these could make a good replacement of plant #5 on the list, depending on your personal taste. Snake plants are just so easy to grow, will tolerate so many conditions, and can come any size. Philodendrons are also great plants and come in lots of varieties, but I've omitted them just since they're so similar to pothos (and I think pothos vines slightly better than philodendrons). That being said, you could easily just replace pothos with philodendron plants for the same effect, depending on your personal taste.
