There seems to be a surprising lack of well designed websites, that also have content focused on plants. Given that this site is obviously in 1st place, here are 3 other plant-sites that are also well designed.

## 1: [The Sill](https://www.thesill.com/)

[The Sill](https://www.thesill.com/) is a potted-plant retailer out of New York City. Their website serves as a digital marketplace, as well as offering [plant-care guides](https://www.thesill.com/pages/plant-care-articles). Check out their [locations](https://www.thesill.com/pages/locations) page for pictures of their store fronts. Speaking of well designed fronts, the website's front-end is something to marvel at. The site has a simple but interesting logo animation as you scroll downs, and makes great use of [Klim Type Foundery's](https://klim.co.nz/) new *[Domaine](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/domaine-display/)* typeface.

## 2: [ELEVEN PLANTS FOR DUM-DUMS & COOL PPL](http://www.elevenplantsfordumdums.com/)

This experimental website is the latest created by [Drew Marshall](http://www.workbydrew.com/), which although uses plants as a focus, is actually about fonts. I know, I'm in heaven. ["ELEVEN PLANTS FOR DUM-DUMS & COOL PPL"](http://www.elevenplantsfordumdums.com/) displays 11 plants, each with its own font pairings and design. There is quite a bit of animation, as well as a little bit of custom type. Overall a very aesthetically pleasing, as well as aesthetically diverse website.

## 3: [Richters Herbs](http://www.herbs.com/)

The OG plant-site is hosted at the coveted [herbs.com](http://www.herbs.com/) (not to be confused with [herb.co](https://herb.co/), a well designed website focusing on just one plant in particular). The design of the site hasn't really changed since 2011, and has always maintained a [relatively consistent style](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210103217/http://www.richters.com:80/) since its creation in 1996. The reason for this is because there really isn't much room for improvement. The site pairs a few different weights of *[Arial](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/arial)*, a typeface by [Monotype](https://www.monotype.com/) that's design can be traced back to [Haas Grotesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica). The typeface is timeless in its simplicity, and is beautifully shown off on a variety of green backgrounds (such as #8b4, #A4C973, and #123108) that have [honestly](https://web.archive.org/web/19961114011853/http://www.richters.com:80/) [not](https://web.archive.org/web/19980612140123/http://www.richters.com:80/) [changed](https://web.archive.org/web/20001109152300/http://www.richters.com:80/) [over](https://web.archive.org/web/20040615030937/http://richters.com:80/) [20](https://web.archive.org/web/20060803133732/http://richters.com:80/) [years](https://web.archive.org/web/20110802154943/http://www.richters.com/).
