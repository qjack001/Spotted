As my obssesion with plants continues, I've realized the best alternative to spending all my money is learning how to propagate. Growing plants from seed is special, but for more immediate satisfaction- making plant cuttings is where it's at. 

I've discovered a niche of plant enthusiasts on the internet, and their dedication and excitement is very wholesome and has made watching plant videos my new favorite pasttime. Here is a compilation of some of the helpful youtube videos I've found so far:

## Pothos propagation
Inspired Jack to propagate his own cuttings

This video gives you a good rundown on propagating basil. They give good tips on where to make cuttings, how to get it to root afterwards, and what to do with cuttings in general. (It's also really satisfying because he shows the growth of all his basil plants over time lapse)

## Propagating and collecting wild moss

I love this guys attitude and commentary. He's crazy passionate about moss, and this video made me want to start my own little moss bed.

## Hens and chicks

I used this to propgate my own hens and chicks- hopefully it holds up! This plant it similar to spider plants in that they produce their own clonal offspring, and all you have to do to propagate them is seperate the babies ("chicks") from the mother plant.
