Nothing to add a bit of mexican flavor to your life like adding these succulents to your lawn. With your newfound wordliness, you may finally be able to handle the 'muy picante' salsa at chipotle. 

There's lots more alternatives to grass- for something much simpler, check out this guide to maintaining a [moss lawn](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/lawn-care/lawn-substitutes/moss-lawn/how-to-grow-a-moss-lawn.htm).

Good luck and enjoy your new jazzy lawn.
