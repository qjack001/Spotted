I thought I'd share a few of my favorite plant pictures from Morocco, since this is where they would have gone. The majority come from [le Jardin Majorelle](http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/), an agressively exotic cactus garden that was bought and restored by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé in 1980, who found the place to be a major art inspiration. I'd agree:

## Park Entrance

Upon entering you are greeted by cacti over 5 meters tall.

Followed by giant succulents the size of a bush.

It was funny, because it had the landscaping of an ornate rose garden, but instead filled with cacti.

## Winning shots

The colors and textures were very aesthetically pleasing.
